## Intro
Hi! I'm Aiden Tabrah, a computer science undergraduate with a passion for learning to create projects that blend the beauty of artistry and the functionality of computer science. Right now I think that blend is somewhere in game design, but I do think that is way too narrow of a scope. I'm looking to diversify my portfolio and skills to give me the tools necessary to make my ideas a reality.

## Projects

### Gonzaga Hackathon 2023 - ByteLands
* Worked with Gabe DiMartino, Izzy Tilles, and Miles Mercer - 3 other second-year computer science majors at Gonzaga
* Used OpenAI to create a virutal medieval village simulation with agents that independently make decisions on what they want to say or do next
* Placed 2nd overall in the Hackathon

### Gonzaga Hackathon 2022 - Madd-E
* Worked with Gabe DiMartino, Charles Bennington, and Alex Nicalozzo - 3 other first-year computer science majors at Gonzaga.
* Used DepthAI Image Recognition technology to create a randomly generated text to speech madlib - I worked mainly on the C++ code
* Placed 2nd overall in the Hackathon

### Creating video games - Canopy, Goblin Brew
* Worked with Alex Koenig, another computer science major at Portland State University
* Foraying into the game-making field by learning the basics - map design, asset creation, and implementing creative solutions to unique problems
* Adapting to improve skills we lack, and independently carrying out a project planned by us.

## Skills
### Composition
* Using FL Studio to make comprehensive tracks
* Distinctive sounds by using my tuba and piano performance skills to add some live music to the mix

### Coding
* Languages are C++/lua/python/sql
* Extremely adaptable and quick to learn - years of independently learning allow me to figure out how to achieve results beyond my skill level

### Group Collaboration
* Can effectively use tools such as Trello, Miro, Discord, Teams, and Google Docs to organize the workflow, communicate effectively, and brainstorm or document important information
