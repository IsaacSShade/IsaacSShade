## Intro
Hi! I'm Aiden Tabrah, a computer science undergraduate with a passion for learning to create projects that blend the beauty of artistry and the functionality of computer science. Right now I think that blend is somewhere in game development, but I do think that is way too narrow of a scope to hone in on while I'm still figuring out what I want to do. I'm looking to diversify my portfolio and skills to give me the tools necessary to make my ideas a reality.

## Work Experience
